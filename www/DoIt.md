=================================

This application allows for scoring points in traditional rubber bridge ("above the line" and "below the line"). Just create a new game and add deals, providing a declarer, a contract, its result, and additional bonuses. The interface is very simple and intuitive, and there is also a help available. The application displays a score sheet in a form of a table. You can also switch to a list view of all deals.
